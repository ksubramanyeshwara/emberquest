                company.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h3>4. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h3>
            <p>In Short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have
                access to
                certain information about you.

                Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account
                details (like your
                Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information
                about you from
                your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media
                provider
                concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well
                as other
                information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.

                We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice
                or that are
                otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not
                responsible for,
                other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you
                review their
                privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can
                set your
                privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h3>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h3>
            <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes outlined in this
                privacy notice
                unless otherwise required by law.



                We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
                this privacy
                notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or
                other legal
                requirements).

                When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either
                delete or
                anonymise such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
                has been stored
                in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
                further processing
                until deletion is possible.</p>


            <br><br>
            <h3>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h3>
            <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organisational and technical
                security
                measures.
                <br><br>
                We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organisational security measures designed
                to protect the
                security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure
                your information,
                no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
                100% secure, so
                we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorised third parties will
                not be able to
                defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will
                do our best to
                protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at
                your own risk.
                You should only access the Services within a secure environment.
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h3>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
            <p>In Short: You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.
                <br><br>
                Withdrawing your consent: If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which
                may be express
                and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at
                any time. You can
                withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section
                'HOW CAN YOU
                CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?' below.

                However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal
                nor, when
                applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
                on lawful
                processing grounds other than consent.
                <br>

            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h3>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h3>
            <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track
                ('DNT') feature or
                setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
                activities
                monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognising and implementing
                DNT signals has
                been finalised. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
                automatically
                communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we
                must follow in
                the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>

            <br><br>
            <h3>9. DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h3>
            <p>In Short: You may have additional rights based on the country you reside in.
                <br>
                <b>Australia</b>

                We collect and process your personal information under the obligations and conditions set by Australia's

                information.

                If you do not wish to provide the personal information necessary to fulfill their applicable purpose, it
                may affect our
                ability to provide our services, in particular:

                offer you the products or services that you want

                respond to or help with your requests
                <br>
                At any time, you have the right to request access to or correction of your personal information. You can
                make such a
                request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section 'HOW CAN YOU REVIEW,
                UPDATE, OR DELETE THE
                DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?'
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h3>10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h3>
            <p>In Short: Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.
                <br>
                We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated
                'Revised' date
                and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to
                this privacy
