                Services
                constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us. Our failure to exercise or enforce
                any right or
                provision of these Legal Terms shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal
                Terms operate to
                the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of our rights and obligations to others
                at any time. We
                shall not be responsible or liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause
                beyond our
                reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal Terms is determined to be
                unlawful, void, or
                unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and
                does not affect
                the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no joint venture, partnership,
                employment or
                agency relationship created between you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services.
                You agree that
                these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having drafted them. You hereby waive
                any and all
                defences you may have based on the electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the
                parties hereto to
                execute these Legal Terms.
